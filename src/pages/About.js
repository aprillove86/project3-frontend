            <p class='first'>
                At every stage of my education, I was incentivized to get
                the best grades and highest gpa with cash, trophies,
                certificates, and occasionally higher self-esteem. The aim
                of $(fetch) is to bring together fly do-gooders that wish
                to offline premium products (sneakers) to high-acheiving
                scholars at the high school and college level.
            </p>

                Scholars can browse the marketplace for sauce that suits
                their taste and place bids using up-to-date, verified and/or
                authenticated report cards and transcripts. Randomization ensures that 
                monthly winners get their requested items.
